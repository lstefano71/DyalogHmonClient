# Architectural Decision Record (ADR-002): API Design for Data Retrieval in `HmonOrchestrator`

**Status:** Implemented

## Context

The `Dyalog.Hmon.Client.Lib` needs to provide consumers with access to "fact" data from Dyalog interpreters. The library contains an internal `_factCache` to improve performance by storing recently received facts. A critical architectural decision must be made on how the public API should expose data from this cache versus fetching fresh data from the remote source.

Two primary design patterns were considered:

1. **The "Read-Through Cache" Pattern (Rejected):** A single method, `GetFact<T>`, would transparently handle data retrieval. If a fresh value exists in the cache, it's returned instantly. If the cache is empty or the data is stale, the method would automatically trigger a network call to fetch fresh data before returning. This pattern prioritizes consumer convenience.

2. **The Command-Query Separation (CQS) Pattern (Chosen):** The API provides two distinct types of methods. One set of methods acts as pure **Queries** (reading from the cache only), while another set acts as pure **Commands** (initiating a network call). This pattern prioritizes predictability and explicit control.

The decision on which pattern to adopt will fundamentally define the library's performance characteristics, its usability, and the robustness of applications built on top of it.

## Decision

We will formally adopt and enforce a strict **Command-Query Separation (CQS)** pattern for all data retrieval in the `HmonOrchestrator`. The API will provide two distinct and predictable mechanisms for accessing fact data:

1. **The Query: `T? GetFact<T>(...)` and `(T?, DateTimeOffset?) GetFactWithTimestamp<T>(...)`**
    * **Role:** These methods are pure, non-blocking **Queries**.
    * **Behavior:** They **only** read from the in-memory cache. They **must never** initiate network I/O. Their execution time is guaranteed to be fast and constant (nanoseconds).
    * **Return Value:** They will return `null` if the requested fact is not present in the cache OR if the cached data is older than the configured `FactCacheTTL` (as per Feature Brief #3). A non-null return value is a guarantee that the data is considered fresh.

2. **The Command: `async Task<FactsResponse> GetFactsAsync(...)`**
    * **Role:** This method is a pure, potentially long-running **Command**.
    * **Behavior:** It **always** initiates a network I/O call to the Dyalog interpreter to request fresh data. It is asynchronous, and its performance cost is made explicit to the consumer via the `await` keyword.
    * **Side Effect:** A successful call to `GetFactsAsync` will populate the cache with the newly retrieved fresh data, which will then be available to subsequent calls to `GetFact<T>`.

The responsibility for implementing a "read-through" pattern (i.e., "query the cache, and if it's null, command a refresh") is explicitly placed on the **consumer**. This gives the consumer full control over when to incur the cost of a network operation.

## Consequences

* **Positive:**
  * **Performance Predictability (The "Pit of Success"):** This is the primary benefit. Consumers can safely call `GetFact<T>` from performance-sensitive code (e.g., UI rendering loops, high-frequency services) with absolute confidence that it will not introduce unpredictable, multi-second latency spikes. It prevents developers from accidentally "falling into" a performance trap.
  * **Explicit Control:** The API is honest about its costs. The `async Task` signature of `GetFactsAsync` clearly signals a potentially expensive operation that the developer must consciously `await`. This empowers the consumer to build more robust applications by deciding precisely when to use cached data versus when to demand fresh data.
  * **API Clarity:** The contract for each method is simple and unambiguous. One reads, one fetches. This makes the library easier to reason about and less prone to misuse.
  * **Simplified Error Handling:** The fast, non-blocking `GetFact<T>` cannot fail with network exceptions, simplifying its usage. All network-related exceptions (`HmonConnectionException`, `CommandTimeoutException`, etc.) are correctly scoped to the `GetFactsAsync` command.

* **Negative:**
  * **Increased Consumer Verbosity:** The most direct trade-off is that a consumer wishing to implement a simple "get-or-fetch" logic must write slightly more code (the `if (cache.Get() is null) { result = await network.Fetch(); }` pattern). This is deemed an acceptable price for the significant gains in predictability and safety.
  * **Requires Developer Education:** Consumers of the library must be taught to understand this design. The documentation (guides and XML comments) must clearly explain the distinct roles of the `Query` and `Command` methods and emphasize that a `null` return from `GetFact<T>` is a normal, expected condition, not an error.

## **Suggested Usage Patterns**

This section provides concrete examples of how a consumer should interact with the API based on this decision. The key is that the consumer must decide how to react to a `null` response from the `GetFact` query based on their application's specific needs.

### **Pattern 1: Display-Oriented Usage (UI Dashboards, Live Views)

**Goal:** Prioritize UI responsiveness. Never block. Eventual consistency is acceptable.

### Implementation

Rely on background polling to update the cache. The UI thread only ever performs the fast, non-blocking `GetFact` query. A `null` result is treated as a valid display state.

```csharp
// Inside a UI refresh loop (e.g., Spectre.Console Live Display)
public void RenderDashboard(Guid sessionId)
{
    // Query: Fast, non-blocking, will not cause UI stutter.
    var workspaceFact = _orchestrator.GetFact<WorkspaceFact>(sessionId);
    var threadCountFact = _orchestrator.GetFact<ThreadCountFact>(sessionId);

    // Handle null by showing a placeholder.
    string wsUsageDisplay = workspaceFact?.Used.ToString("N0") ?? "Awaiting data...";
    string threadDisplay = threadCountFact?.Total.ToString() ?? "---";

    // Render the values.
    Console.WriteLine($"Workspace Usage: {wsUsageDisplay}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Thread Count:    {threadDisplay}");
}
```

### **Pattern 2: Consumer-Side Read-Through (General Purpose Logic)**

**Goal:** Get a fact value, preferring a fresh cached value but fetching it from the source if necessary. The caller understands and accepts that this operation may involve a network call.

### Implementation

The consumer implements the "Query-Then-Command" logic. This pattern should be encapsulated within an `async` method to make its nature clear.

```csharp
public async Task<WorkspaceFact?> GetGuaranteedWorkspaceFactAsync(Guid sessionId)
{
    // 1. Query: First, try the fast cache lookup.
    var cachedFact = _orchestrator.GetFact<WorkspaceFact>(sessionId);
    if (cachedFact is not null)
    {
        return cachedFact; // Cache hit, return immediately.
    }

    // 2. Command: Cache miss or data was stale. Explicitly fetch fresh data.
    try
    {
        Log.Information("Cache miss for WorkspaceFact. Fetching from source...");
        var response = await _orchestrator.GetFactsAsync(sessionId, new[] { FactType.Workspace });
        
        // Return the fresh fact from the response. The cache is now also updated.
        return response.Facts.OfType<WorkspaceFact>().FirstOrDefault();
    }
    catch (HmonException ex) // Catch specific, typed exceptions.
    {
        Log.Error(ex, "Failed to retrieve fresh fact for session {SessionId}.", sessionId);
        return null; // The operation failed, return null.
    }
}
```

## **Pattern 3: Guaranteed Freshness (Critical Operations)**

**Goal:** The operation requires the absolute latest data from the source of truth, and the cost of a network call is acceptable.

### Implementation

Bypass the `GetFact` query entirely and go straight to the `GetFactsAsync` command. This is common for user-initiated actions.

```csharp
public async Task GenerateDiagnosticReport(Guid sessionId)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Generating report... (this may take a moment)");
    
    try
    {
        // Command: Directly fetch fresh data. Do not check the cache.
        var facts = await _orchestrator.GetFactsAsync(sessionId, new[] { 
            FactType.Host, 
            FactType.Workspace, 
            FactType.Threads 
        });

        // ... use the fresh 'facts' to build and save the report.
        Console.WriteLine("Report generated successfully.");
    }
    catch (CommandTimeoutException ex)
    {
        Console.Error.WriteLine($"Error: The interpreter for session {sessionId} is unresponsive.");
    }
}
```

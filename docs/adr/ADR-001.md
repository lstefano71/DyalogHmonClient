# **ADR-001: Unified Event Stream for `HmonOrchestrator`

**Status:** Implemented

## Context

The `HmonOrchestrator` class, which is the primary entry point to the client library, currently exposes two different models for consuming events:

1. A modern, pull-based asynchronous stream: `public IAsyncEnumerable<HmonEvent> Events { get; }`
2. A set of traditional, push-based C# events: `ClientConnected`, `ClientDisconnected`, `OnSessionUpdated`.

This dual model creates API confusion, forcing the consumer to subscribe to multiple sources to get a complete picture of the system's state. It also introduces the possibility of race conditions, as the ordering between events raised via C# `event` and events yielded from the `IAsyncEnumerable` is not guaranteed.

## Decision

We will refactor the `HmonOrchestrator` to use a **single, unified event stream** as the sole source of truth for all activities.

1. The C# events (`ClientConnected`, `ClientDisconnected`, `OnSessionUpdated`) will be marked as `[Obsolete]` and subsequently removed in the next major version.
2. New record types will be introduced to represent lifecycle events within the main stream:
    - `public record SessionConnectedEvent(Guid SessionId, string Host, int Port, string? FriendlyName) : HmonEvent(SessionId);`
    - `public record SessionDisconnectedEvent(Guid SessionId, string Reason) : HmonEvent(SessionId);`
3. The internal logic of the orchestrator will be modified to `Post` these new event types to the internal `Channel` instead of invoking the C# events.
4. Consumers will now be instructed to process all events, including connection and disconnection, from the single `orchestrator.Events` stream.

## Consequences

- **Positive:**
  - **Simplified API:** Consumers have a single, predictable place to get all information.
  - **Guaranteed Ordering:** All events are processed in the order they occurred.
  - **Reduced Complexity:** Removes the need for consumers to manage multiple event handlers and subscriptions.
  - **Eliminates Race Conditions:** State changes can be handled atomically within a single `await foreach` loop.

- **Negative:**
  - **Breaking Change:** This is a significant breaking change for any existing consumer of the library. It necessitates a major version bump (e.g., from v1.x to v2.0).
  - **Migration Effort:** Consumers will need to refactor their event handling logic to use the new `switch` pattern on the event stream instead of attaching to C# events. Clear documentation and migration guides will be essential.

This change aligns the library with modern, reactive programming patterns and ultimately leads to a more robust and easier-to-use API, despite the initial cost of the breaking change.

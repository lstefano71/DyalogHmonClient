# Progress: Dyalog.Hmon.Client

_Last reviewed: 2025-07-15 17:48 CEST_

## Current Status
- Core infrastructure and foundational models are implemented.
- HmonOrchestrator constructor, connection management (listener, AddServer, RemoveServerAsync), event handling, and disposal are complete.
- Transparent HMON protocol handshake logic is implemented and validated for all connections.
- JSON serialization and source generation are configured.
- Many core API and event models are implemented and tested.
- **HMon Hub Sample implementation:** configuration-driven console app, .NET 9.0, C# 13, ASP.NET Core Minimal API, Serilog, in-memory aggregation, REST/WebSocket APIs, robust error handling, extensible logging, event subscription, per-session event history, and WebSocket endpoint for real-time event/fact updates.

## What Works
- Project setup and structure (solution, library, console, and test projects).
- Core concepts, configuration, enums, lifecycle event arguments, unified event stream, and message payload models.
- Connection management, handshake protocol, and event handling.
- Unit tests for HmonOrchestrator, HmonConnection, and ServerConnection (construction, disposal, error handling).
- Integration test for end-to-end handshake using MockHmonServer.
- XML documentation for all public APIs in HmonOrchestrator, ServerConnection, and HmonConnection.
- Serilog logging for connection lifecycle, handshake failures, and disposal in HmonOrchestrator.
- Serilog logging for connection attempts, failures, and error diagnostics in ServerConnection and HmonConnection.
- Failed handshakes are robustly detected and cleaned up before consumer exposure.
- Disposal and resource cleanup.
- Consumer workflow example implemented in the console project.
- Sample client and documentation refactored to use SessionMonitorBuilder for session management and state updates.
- Sample client documentation updated at `docs/sample-client.md` to describe builder-based workflow.
- Documentation reviewed and updated.
- HMon Hub Sample: configuration-driven console app, config loader (CLI/env overrides), Serilog logging (console/extensible), HMon server connectivity and poll listener, in-memory aggregation of facts, REST API endpoints (/facts, /status) using ASP.NET Core Minimal API, WebSocket endpoint (/ws) for real-time event/fact updates, robust error handling and reconnection logic, event subscription, per-session event history.

## What's Left to Build
- Write and run unit/integration tests for all core logic.
- Add comprehensive XML documentation to all public APIs.
- Thoroughly test handshake, interaction API, connection retry logic, error handling, and state management.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Known Issues
- Testing and documentation are not yet fully complete.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Implementation follows PRD and memory bank best practices.
- Tasks and progress are tracked in TODO.md and reflected here for accuracy.

_Memory bank fully reviewed and confirmed up to date as of 2025-07-15 17:48 CEST._

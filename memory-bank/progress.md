# Progress: Dyalog.Hmon.Client

## Current Status
- Core infrastructure and foundational models are implemented.
- HmonOrchestrator constructor, connection management (listener, AddServer, RemoveServerAsync), event handling, and disposal are complete.
- Transparent HMON protocol handshake logic is implemented and validated for all connections.
- JSON serialization and source generation are configured.
- Many core API and event models are implemented and tested.

## What Works
- Project setup and structure (solution, library, console, and test projects).
- Core concepts, configuration, enums, lifecycle event arguments, unified event stream, and message payload models.
- Connection management, handshake protocol, and event handling.
- Unit tests for HmonOrchestrator, HmonConnection, and ServerConnection (construction, disposal, error handling).
- Integration test for end-to-end handshake using MockHmonServer.
- XML documentation for all public APIs in HmonOrchestrator, ServerConnection, and HmonConnection.
- Serilog logging for connection lifecycle, handshake failures, and disposal in HmonOrchestrator.
- Serilog logging for connection attempts, failures, and error diagnostics in ServerConnection and HmonConnection.
- Failed handshakes are robustly detected and cleaned up before consumer exposure.
- Disposal and resource cleanup.

## What's Left to Build
- Reliability: test handshake, interaction API, connection retry logic, error handling, and state management.
- Usability: add XML documentation to all public APIs.
- Testability: write and run unit and integration tests for all core logic.
- Example application: implement consumer workflow in the console project.
- Documentation: review and update all documentation, including README.md.

## Known Issues
- Reliability and error handling require thorough testing.
- Documentation and tests are incomplete.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Implementation follows PRD and memory bank best practices.
- Tasks and progress are tracked in TODO.md and reflected here for accuracy.
